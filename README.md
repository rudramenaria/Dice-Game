# Dice-Game

A new Flutter project.

This is a simple Dice game build with Flutter and Firebase.
In this i have used flutter authentication [https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth] for registration and login.
It has mainly two screens one is Dashboard/Leardboard and another where you can play the game by simply clicking a button.
Used Stream in the Leardboard page to make it realtime by using cloud firestore [https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore].
